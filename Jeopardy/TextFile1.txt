make it so all the buttons can be rendered through one "controller" data structure
	- try a 2D array of buttons (would have to do the 2D array nested for loop for the rendering)
	- try several arrays of buttons; one array for each row or column

look into the functionality of events and delegates
	- see if you can have a "Question" object associated with each button so that when you press the button 
	- the "Question" object that's associated with that button becomes the "currentQuestion" object that's getting rendered to the screen

see about having several players
	- i'm thinking having a list of "Team" objects that can render the team name/number and their point value
	- for getting the render to line up correctly you can make it so the controller can calculate the collective height of all the "team" 
	objects and center the section based on that (loop through all the elements in the list, add all their heights to a seprate variable, 
	use that height against the total height of the window, then center it based off the remaining area of the screen) 
	(i.e., if I have 5 teams and the combined height is 400px then I'd subtract that from the height of the window (480) 
	get the difference (80) split it in half (40) and use that half as the x position for the topmost team (so team one's x position is 40))
